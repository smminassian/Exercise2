        <b>Instructions</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente,
             according to package instructions; drain and reserve.</li>
             <li>In a small bowl, combine ricotta, egg, a third of the Parmesan, 
              and half the mozzarella; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In the bottom of a shallow 2-quart casserole dish, spread half the tomato sauce. Top with ziti, then ricotta mixture and remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and mozzarella. Place casserole on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until top is browned and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare garlic bread: Make deep, even cuts into the bread, about 1/2 inch apart, without cutting through the bottom. In a small bowl, combine butter and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Brush garlic butter between cuts in bread. Wrap bread loosely in aluminum foil, and bake with ziti during last 10 minutes of baking.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar and oil; season with salt and pepper. Add endive and arugula, and toss to coat. Serve baked ziti with salad and garlic bread.</li>
